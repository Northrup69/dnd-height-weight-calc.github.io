# <img src="https://github.com/Northrup69/dnd-height-weight-calc/blob/main/assets/icon.svg?raw=true" alt="Icon" style="height:32px;"> D&D Height & Weight Calculator
A very simple calculator for the height and weight of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition characters, which I pieced together some time ago for an acquaintance who always struggles with the math.
  
<br>
<br>
  
## Features
This Webpage provides a simple user interface to easily calculate the height and weight for your Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition characters and display the results in imperial and metric units.

## How to use
Open the [D&D Height & Weight Calculator](https://northrup69.github.io/dnd-height-weight-calc) Webpage and enter the *Base Height*, *Height Modifier*, *Base Weight*, and *Weight Modifier* specified for your character's race in the corresponding boxes and click on the Calculate button.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> You can either roll the modifiers yourself and enter the result, or switch to the Digital Dice Rolling method and roll the dice on the webpage.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the *Base Height*, *Height Modifier*, *Base Weight*, and *Weight Modifier* for each race in the *Random Height and Weight* table in the ***[Basic Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/personality-and-background#HeightandWeight)***, or in the ***Player's Handbook (2014)*** on page 121.

<br>

After the calculation, the following data is displayed:
* Height (in ft & in and cm)
* Weight (in lbs and kg) 
* Build (Slender, Average, Broad, Massive; color-coded)
* Human-equivalent BMI (Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, Obesity Class I-III; color-coded)
* Calculation Details
